This is a Quine (program that outputs its own source code) that I wrote in Java.
The code is compressed as much as possible as to produce the shortest solution.

A short description of how it works:

It first makes character variables that store the # and " characters.  Then it
makes a string [a] that prints out the program header and everything up to that
declaration of that string.  Next, it prints two ## characters.  Then it prints
all of that code that comes after the string declaration.  After the declaration
of [a], I make another string [b] that replaces the ## with "".  Then I print out
[b] up to the ", then I print [a], and finally I print the rest of [b] after the
".
